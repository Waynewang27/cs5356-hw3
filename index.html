        Youâ€™ve probably met plenty of Waynes, but here's a fun fact: my legal first name is Wei. Since "Wei" sounds pretty close to "Wayne," I figured, why not roll with it? So, if you ever meet another Wayne, just remember, I might be the only one who got here through a linguistic shortcut.

        <li><strong>Product Specialist</strong> â€“ on a mission to create meaningful things and actually bridge the gap</li>

        <li><strong>Critical Thinker & Listener</strong> â€“ I swear I listen and think before I start outputting too much</li>
        <li><strong>Empathetic Perceiver</strong> â€“ I always see the world, the people from a third-person perspective</li>

        I define myself as above, but Iâ€™m always open to more or to the challenge of these identities youâ€™ve picked up on through our conversations! Just as Game of Thrones puts it, "Any man who must say, 'I am the King,' is no true king."

          I learned that the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element provides a native, interactive way to hide and reveal additional content. This enhances user experience by letting visitors control how much information they want to seeâ€”all without extra JavaScript.

        I also experimented with the CSS property <code>mix-blend-mode</code> (applied to my image above), which blends the image colors with the background to create a unique visual effect. This property allows for creative design effects directly in CSS.
