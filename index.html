      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/Me.JPG" alt="Picture of myself">
      <p>
        You’ve probably met plenty of Waynes, but here's a fun fact: my legal first name is Wei. Since "Wei" sounds pretty close to "Wayne," I figured, why not roll with it? So, if you ever meet another Wayne, just remember, I might be the only one who got here through a linguistic shortcut.
      </p>
      <p>Beyond the name, I’m ...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Specialist</strong> – on a mission to create meaningful things and actually bridge the gap</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Solver</strong> – creative or practical, your call :></li>
        <li><strong>Critical Thinker & Listener</strong> – I swear I listen and think before I start outputting too much</li>
        <li><strong>Empathetic Perceiver</strong> – I always see the world, the people from a third-person perspective</li>
        <li><strong>User Myself</strong> – bad design genuinely annoys me, so I can’t help but fix it</li>
        <li><strong>Sports Lover & Video Gamer</strong> – lifelong, unstoppable, and here to stay ;></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I define myself as above, but I’m always open to more or to the challenge of these identities you’ve picked up on through our conversations! Just as Game of Thrones puts it, "Any man who must say, 'I am the King,' is no true king."

      <p>So, let’s talk—better call Wayne! 🚀</p>
